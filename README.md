# Galileo 2 CAN/Umbilical Mount

Creates a mount for PG7 or M12 cable glands for umbilical setups with the Galileo 2.  Utilizes the existing M3 insert on the back of the extruder and requires only a single M3x10mm bolt to secure in place.
I utilized the original step file from [JaredC01](https://github.com/JaredC01/Galileo2) to create this.  None of the original parts are changed or require modification.

## Printing

I print this with the normal Voron part settings.  You will need to utilize supports.  If there is interest, I may add a version with integrated supports, but I didn't find there to be a need for anything custom while printing.

## Versions

- PG7 - Fits a PG7 cable gland
- M12 - Fits an M12x1.5 cable gland
- Blank - A Blank version that you can use to create your own custom version.
